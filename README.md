## What is ReconX?

ReconX is an **intelligence layer** for attack surface reconnaissance — it is **NOT** a wrapper around existing tools.

While traditional recon scripts simply chain tools together and dump raw output, ReconX **orchestrates** tool execution, **correlates** findings across modules, **enriches** data with context, **scores** assets by risk, and **reports** actionable intelligence in multiple formats.

Every discovered asset flows through a unified pipeline where it is deduplicated, validated, classified, scored, and stored in a structured database. The result is not a pile of text files — it's a prioritized, queryable attack surface map.

---

## Why ReconX?

### Traditional Workflow

```
subfinder -d target.com -o subs.txt
cat subs.txt | httpx -o live.txt
cat live.txt | katana -o urls.txt
cat urls.txt | nuclei -o findings.txt

# Now what?
# - Thousands of lines across 4 files
# - No correlation between findings
# - No prioritization
# - No change tracking
# - Manual analysis required
```

### ReconX Workflow

```
reconx deep target.com

# Complete pipeline with intelligence:
# ✔ Asset Discovery     → deduplicated, scope-validated subdomains
# ✔ Port Scanning       → correlated with each subdomain
# ✔ HTTP Validation     → live hosts with tech fingerprinting
# ✔ Visual Recon        → screenshot capture for rapid triage
# ✔ Web Crawling        → endpoint extraction + classification
# ✔ Historical Recon    → Wayback Machine + GAU archive mining
# ✔ JS Intelligence     → secrets, API keys, endpoints from JS files
# ✔ Risk Scoring        → every asset scored 0-100
# ✔ Vuln Scanning       → smart, targeted Nuclei scanning
# ✔ Change Detection    → diff against previous scans
# ✔ Reporting           → HTML, JSON, Markdown reports generated
```

```

Each module receives validated input from the previous stage, processes it through the corresponding external tool (subprocess, never shell), and feeds enriched output into the next stage. All data is persisted to a local SQLite database for querying, comparison, and reporting.

## Scan Profiles

| Profile | Modules Executed | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| **quick** | Subfinder → Httpx | Rapid triage of a new target in under 2 minutes |
| **standard** | Subfinder → Naabu → Httpx → Katana → Nuclei | Normal bug bounty or pentest workflow |
| **deep** | All modules (incl. GAU, JS analysis, screenshots) | Maximum coverage for high-value targets |

```bash
reconx quick target.com       # Fast recon
reconx standard target.com    # Balanced coverage
reconx deep target.com        # Full intelligence
```

## Security

ReconX is built with security as a first-class concern:

1. **Input Validation** — All targets and parameters are validated against strict patterns
2. **Command Injection Prevention** — Subprocess calls use `shell=False` with argument lists, never string interpolation
3. **Path Traversal Protection** — All file paths are validated and confined to the workspace
4. **Scope Enforcement** — Targets are checked against the defined scope before every operation
5. **Output Sanitization** — Tool output is sanitized before processing and storage
6. **Audit Logging** — Every command executed is logged with full arguments and timestamps
7. **Rate Limiting** — Configurable rate limits to prevent accidental abuse
